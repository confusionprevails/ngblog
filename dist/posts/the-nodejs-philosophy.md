### NodeJS
In traditional Web Apps, we need to send/receive data through AJAX calls, identify the UI elements, update the UI elements. 
There is a lot of boilerplate code we need to write.

AngularJS's core feature - data-binding can save several lines of code. Data-Binding allows us to bind data to HTML and it automatically takes
 care of updating the UI whenever the data changes.
  
eg.

    Hello <span>{{ name }}</span>
    

The above HTML snippet ensures that anytime the `name` value changes, the UI reflects the change.

With such data-binding features, developers can focus more on writing the core business logic instead of writing boilerplate code to funnel data
between UI and model. 

*Change the model and let Angular update the UI.*
